            <h2><u>Postmodal Art</u></h2>
            <p class="text-justify">The composer can no longer be merely a composer of music - they must also compose with visuals, interactivity, improvisation, or other disciplines. This phenomenon, observable in all classical mediums, is largely due to the advances in technology available to the modern creative. It is no new occurrence that a 12-year-old equipped with the right software can compose music that rivals what currently tops the pop charts. The man with an iPhone can begin shooting a documentary at any moment at a reasonable level of production quality.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-justify">Academia must begin to look forward into these new integrative artforms in ways that equip the modern creative with usable skills. The in-vogue tools and mediums now evolve so fast that it is ineffective to focus on learning one tool in-depth. Tape music, which was very popular in the 1980s now lacks significant representation at the largest electronic music conferences - with many of these conferences now favoring interactive multimedia works. The most promising path forward is for the artist to attempt to link two or more disparate disciplines with the intent of deriving postmodal design principles that may be applied to any future medium that may become useful to them. This is similar to the concept of the "polyglot" in computer programming. It isn't the language you learn that is important, it's the concepts behind it.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-justify">My dissertation work outlines the connection between music and VR (a medium that encompasses countless other component mediums). Scholars such as Serafin, Kojs, et al. have mused on the connection between these two disciplines, but much is lacking in the specific area of music-first VR. The final manifestation of my dissertation work was a postmodal work titled <b>Abstruse</b>. I built this site to document Abstruse - scroll down the page to see it in action, and to learn more.</p></p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Challenge</h2>
          <p>Creating this work required keeping in delicate balance three main considerations: my design aesthetic, the interests of the advisory committee, and the use of highly complex technology.</p>
          <h3>Design Aesthetic</h3>
          <p>At some level, and against all odds for a dissertation project, I resolved to make a work of art. At present day, art is a lot of different things for a lot of different people. Briefly put, I take a Romantic view of the artistic work - that it should be an expression of intimate personal experience with the intent of communicating this experience.</p>
          <h3>The Committee</h3>
          <p>Two features of the PhD process in a digital arts discipline, in particular, create unique challenges. Firstly, there are no longer any widely-agreed-upon standards of better and worse in academic art. The most useful way I found to counteract this was to focus the committee on my technical achievements - software coded, technology used, etc. as these things are more easily quantifiable. Secondly, members of my committee were differently weighted in terms of skill set. This proved to be both a strength and an obstacle. Committee members were able to provide master-level insights into their narrow areas of research that pertained to my work. However, creative members lacked an understanding of the technical elements, and technical members lacked an understanding of the creative elements. I overcame this by overcommunicating in the written dissertation.</p>
          <h3>High Tech</h3>
          <p>A full list of technologies used is available <a href="#tech-used">further up on the page</a>. The primary technological challenge was linking everything. I settled on a combination of OSC, MIDI, and various C# scripts in order to allow programs such as MaxMSP, Ableton Live, and Unity to "talk" to each other.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 breathing-room text-justify">
          <h2 class="text-center">Process</h2>
          <p>As with all of my artistic work, I sought to base this one on a story. The most compelling story for me around the time that I began development on <b>Abstruse</b> was the increased use and dependence of young people on social media, and the effects that this was having on autonomy, mental health, etc.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid upper-space" alt="Researching in journals over coffee." src="img/text-section/research.jpg" />
          <h3>Concepts Explored</h3>
          <p>I was reading a lot of material on VR in order to think more clearly about the principles I would explore in my written dissertation when I was drawn to the readings of Luddite author, and inventor of virtual reality, Jaron Lanier. In his work <b>You Are Not a Gadget</b>, Lanier compares exploitative VR development, and by logical extension, social media to the concept of a Skinner Box. You’re probably familiar with the concept as I was even if you don’t recognize the name. A Skinner Box is an apparatus for lab animal stimulus conditioning. A rat that is rewarded with food pellets or shocked with electricity based on its behavior is a simple version of this.</p>
          <h3>Mediums</h3>
          <p>In order for the artwork to be maximally expressive in a postmodal domain I knew I had to choose mediums that would help to represent the meaning of the work. I settled upon the medium most traditionally used as a Skinner Box - music, as well as the one that is at highest risk of being used as a Skinner Box in the future - virtual reality.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 breathing-room text-justify">
          <h2 class="text-center">Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">As with all real-world testing, the results were complex. The work was a success in the regard that it accomplished what it set out to do: portray the manipulative power of technology and social media through operant conditioning of a test subject. While watching the projected output of the VR headset wearer's navigation of the world, I rewarded those who created a pleasing and dynamic flow through the environment by generating harmonious and listenable music. This created a feedback loop of rewards begetting more rewards. Those that deviated from a desirable navigation were stimulated with cacophonous and distorted sounds until they managed to pilot the headset more successfully.</p>
          <h3>Future Directions</h3>
          <p>There are two streams of research that must be more sufficiently delved into - audio-first VR, and postmodal studies. Modern VR developers have the opportunity to completely subvert existing video game paradigms in search of something more interesting. Little other than auxiliary work has been done on audio-first visuals. Postmodal studies, taken more seriously in academia, would not only serve to open more career doors for artists, but also rapidly accelerate the rate at which postmodernism can be banished from any serious study.</p>
